# Ultimate CICD Project

This repository contains my hands-on implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, Maven, SonarQube, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes for a Java Spring Boot application.

## Project Highlights
- Automated build, scan, and deployment process for a sample Spring Boot app
- Custom modifications and troubleshooting of Jenkins pipelines to make the deployment fully functional
- Integration of multiple DevSecOps tools and practices

## About the Code
- The Java project contains some package names and structure inspired by Abhishek Viramalaâ€™s tutorial repository (e.g., `java.com.abhishek`)  
- All pipeline configurations, deployments, and modifications were implemented and tested by me  
- Extensive troubleshooting and customizations were done to make the pipelines work end-to-end

## Key Takeaways
- Learned end-to-end CI/CD implementation with Kubernetes and ArgoCD  
- Hands-on experience in debugging and modifying pipelines for successful deployments  
- Applied DevSecOps practices including code scanning, quality checks, and automated deployments

## Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge **Abhishek Viramala** for providing the initial tutorial code as a reference. All the pipeline setup, debugging, and deployment work was implemented by me.
